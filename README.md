<h1>First steps with a Simple Component</h1>

React is a JavaScript library, and so it assumes you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don't feel very confident, we recommend refreshing your JavaScript knowledge so you can follow along more easily.

We also use some of the ES6 syntax in the examples. We try to use it sparingly because it's still relatively new, but we encourage you to get familiar with arrow functions, classes, template literals, let, and const statements. You can use Babel REPL to check what ES6 code compiles to.
